<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Once the days start warming up but they've still got that pleasent breeze in the air,
         (think April and May) I excitedly wait by the phone for my best friend 
         Aisha to call. <br> She has hosted some of the best parties I have ever been to. In fact,
        the setting of all my favourite memories is the terrace 
    of her gorgeous London townhouse.</p>
         <p>This deliciously mouth watering salad is a part of one such memory. 
I still remember the frantic phone call I had with her 20 minutes before her party
(which was being held for me) started.<br>
"Anandita PLEASE! please. PLEASE! I know it's your birthday but I NEED you to 
come help me. I'm a mess!." she begged in her Italian accent. 
         </p>
         <p>I didn't think much of this salad at first - after all, 
            it was a product of last minute decisions. But, for some peculiar reason, 
            I just couldn't get it out of my mind.<br>This salad is so special to 
            Aisha and I that it almost feels like I am betraying her by 
            showing it to the world. However, she and I both agree that it is too good to 
            not tell you all about it.</p>

<p>So, with that said, here is what you'll need to prepare it.</p>
